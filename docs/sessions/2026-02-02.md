### BUG-SIDEBAR-SCROLL: Sidebar does not scroll with remote
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
When navigating the sidebar using ArrowDown on a TV remote, items below the visible viewport would not scroll into view. The `focusedIndex` was updating correctly, but the focused item remained off-screen.

**Root Cause:**
The `Sidebar.jsx` component (ADR-003 compliant "dumb" component) was correctly receiving `focusedIndex` from `HomePanel.jsx`, but **there was no scroll-into-view logic** to ensure the focused item remained visible when navigating beyond the screen bounds.

**Solution:**
Modified `Sidebar.jsx` to:
1. Import `useRef` and `useEffect` from React
2. Create an `itemRefs` array to hold refs to each `SidebarItem`
3. Add a `useEffect` that calls `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'nearest' })` when `focusedIndex` changes
4. Convert `SidebarItem` to use `React.forwardRef` to accept the ref

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx`

**ADR-003 Compliance:**
This fix is compliant with ADR-003:
- ❌ Does NOT add keyboard navigation logic to Sidebar
- ❌ Does NOT store any focus state in Sidebar
- ✅ Only adds a **visual side effect** (scroll-into-view)
- ✅ Navigation logic remains centralized in `HomePanel.jsx`
